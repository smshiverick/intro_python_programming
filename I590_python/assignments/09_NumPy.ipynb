    "```\n",
    "row, col = grade.shape\n",
    "```\n",
    "One way to solve this problem is to use a “for” loop and in iteration i process the scores of student in the row i. An algorithms could look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "load the file with data\n",

    "convert final scores into letter grade\n",
    "print and store results into npy files\n",
    "```\n",
    "You may want to use a list to store letter grades, because NumPy will most likely complain about mixing numbers and strings in a same array. If you convert the list with letter grades to an array, than you will be able to use “np.hstack” function to merge two arrays into the final array with id numbers, final scores and letter grades."

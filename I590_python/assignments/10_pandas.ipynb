    "* If you make a decision to buy, you will always invest the complete balance to buy as many shares as possible of the (same) company X.\n",
    "* If you make a decision to sell, you will always sell all shares that you have.\n",
    "* Invest the complete balance into the X shares at the beginning of the time period.\n",
    "* After the close of the market inspect if the shares are down or up compared to the previous close value.\n",
    "* If you are invested (own the shares) and the shares are down for m consecutive days, sell all shares. You sell shares for the close value and you will have cash.\n",
    "* If you are not invested (have cash) and the shares are up for n consecutive days, buy shares of company X for the price of close value.\n",
    "* You are charged 7 dollar fee for each transaction (buy or sell). After you sell, subtract the fee from the sell value to get the balance. Before you buy, first subtract the transaction fee, and then use the resulting balance to buy as many shares as possible.\n",
    "* You sell all shares at the end of the investment period.\n",

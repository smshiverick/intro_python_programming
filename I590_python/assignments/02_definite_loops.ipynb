    "input(\"Enter numbers separated by a space: \").split(sep=\" \")\n",
    "The statement first calls the function ‘input’ which will keep reading user inputs and then split is executed and it will give a list after splitting the input string by space.\n",

    "```\n",
    "input(\"Enter numbers separated by a space: \").split(sep=\" \")\n",
    "Enter numbers separated by a space: 2 5 11 3\n",
    "Out[67]: ['2', '5', '11', '3']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that the statement will give a list containing user entered strings that represent numbers. The elements of the resulting list are strings that represent the numbers, and NOT the actual numbers.\n",
    "2. Use function int() to convert the strings to numbers:\n",
    "```\n",
    "int('2')\n",
    "Out[68]: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. You may also use function len()to count the number of elements in the list. For an example, len([2,3,4]) gives value 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To add up all numbers in a list named “myList”, you can use a loop like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "for x in myList:\n",
    "sum = sum + x\n",
    "```\n",
    "The variable sum is first initialized to 0. Each time through the loop, x gets one element from the list. As the loops runs, sum accumulates the sum of the elements. After the loop completes, the sum will contain the total sum of all numbers in myList."

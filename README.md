## COURSE: INFO-I 590 (34130): Python 						
### Instructor: Vel Malbasa 	 Spring 2017
### Visiting Professor, Computer Science
#### School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University

### Course Description/Overview:
This course provides a gentle, yet intense, introduction to programming in Python for students with little or no prior experience in programming. Python is an open-source language that allows rapid application development of scalable software systems, is object-oriented by design and provides an excellent platform to learn the basics of programming. The course will focus on
planning and organizing programs, and developing high quality, working software that solves real world problems.

### Course Goals: Students will...
* Learn how to design and implement scalable Python programs that solve real world problems, with focus on Data Science applications.
* Learn top-down and object oriented approaches to software design.
* Learn data structures and algorithms used in numeric and text data processing.
Course Learning Objectives:
* Design, code, and test small and medium sized Python programs that meet requirements expressed in English. This includes design and use of procedural statements — assignments, conditional statements, loops, method calls — and sequences. Use Python packages for data science applications and real world data analysis.
* Apply the concepts of top-down design and object-oriented software design as used in Python: classes, subclasses, properties, inheritance and overriding
* Demonstrate understanding and use of basic data structures (including strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples) and algorithms (including searching and sorting).

### Course Prerequisites:
Basic high school mathematics (no calculus) and no programming experience.
